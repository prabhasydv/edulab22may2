                                    Claims that would be barred by applicable law if brought in court. The arbitrator
                                    will give effect to statutes of limitation in determining any Claim and may dismiss
                                    the arbitration on the basis that the Claim is barred. For purposes of the

                                    rules of a notice of Claim is the equivalent of the filing of a lawsuit.
